# 📚 Keddit

> A full-stack social media site.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Keddit is a full-stack social media site that is heavily inspired by Reddit and X.com. I built this project because I wanted to work on key programming skills and technologies such
as complex problem-solving, TypeScript, Third-Party OAuth, and project management. I also utilized Express for the backend Rest API and Prisma ORM + PostegreSQL to 
manage the database relations.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Language(s):** TypeScript 
- **Frameworks:** React / Express  
- **Libraries & Tools:** Prisma / TailwindCSS / Passport.js 
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Render
